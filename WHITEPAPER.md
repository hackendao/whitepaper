# The Hacken DAO - Empowering the Community to Secure the Future of Blockchain

**Version - 1.0.0**

## Introduction

The blockchain revolution has brought about a paradigm shift in how we interact with technology, fostering transparency, immutability, and decentralised governance. However, as this nascent ecosystem grows, so do the challenges surrounding its security. Hacken, a leading force in blockchain security, has consistently innovated and provided vital services to secure the foundations of this transformative technology.

With the emergence of Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), we see a powerful mechanism for collaborative decision-making and collective action which will empower every user/member. As Hacken continuously grows with the talented members and programs such as Trust Army, DYOR Courses and Alpha Intelligence HackenDAO will be the independent trust source apart from the Hacken Company itself which will boost collaborative strength. By harnessing the collective expertise and resources of the Hacken community, we propose the Hacken DAO, a groundbreaking initiative to empower individuals and contribute to the broader security of the blockchain ecosystem. This will allow us to build a secure Web 3.0, being able to DYOR, add recognition and provide a trusted ecosystem around the Hacken token.

During the formation of the hDAO, the Hacken company commits to:

- transfer assets
- transfer primary development
- allocate resources
- provide informational support
- ensure the image and continuous brand awareness

By receiving control over B2C products from the Hacken team, HackenDAO will act as a collective product owner.

This whitepaper outlines the vision, mission, and structure of the Hacken DAO. We aim to create a platform that fosters collaboration, incentivizes contributions, and allows the community to play a direct role in shaping the future of blockchain transparency. As Hacken DAO, we believe in a knowledgeable crypto community with Crypto-Co-Enthusiasts.

## Motivations and Objectives

Influencing the entire blockchain industry in the aspect of developing and implementing best practices and standards in the areas of security and awareness of crypto-bros (DYOR). Stimulating the emergence of new solutions, including automated ones, educate and continuously learn, adapt to new industry challenges based on the vast expertise of hDAO participants to make Web3 a safer place.

#### Empowering the Community

We believe that the collective knowledge and expertise of the Hacken community can be harnessed to achieve greater impact in transparency of the blockchain ecosystem. Thus will allow us to detect bad actors with a final goal of creating an expert community!

#### Decentralising Security Solutions

Thanks to the initiatives such as Trust Army and DYOR courses, we aimed to bring decentralised structure to offer services by the DAO community and whole rewards will be back to the Hacken community.

#### Facilitating Collaboration

The Hacken DAO will provide a platform for individuals and organisations to collaborate on security initiatives, fostering innovation and collective problem-solving.

#### Incentivizing Contributions/Grants

By rewarding contributions to the DAO with HAI tokens, we aim to motivate continued engagement and participation in securing the blockchain space.

Through the achievement of these objectives, Hacken DAO strives to make a significant contribution to the overall security and sustainability of the blockchain ecosystem.

## Proposal Process

### Expectations

1. The main scope of an idea should be HAI and the HAI Community.

2. Only the hDAO Treasury is available to fund ideas, any expectation for funding through other means might result in the rejection of the idea.

3. hDAO does not dictate how Hacken should operate as a company nor what they should do with their own resources (funds, labour, etc).

### Request for Proposals (RFPs)

1. An hDAO Member has an idea for the HAI Community.

2. The hDAO Member creates an RFP via the Google Form found on our socials or website.

3. Supreme Council filtering process for RFP.

   - Discussion; Any concerns with the RFP?
   - Vote on whether the RFP is clear, feasible, and worthwhile.
   - Flagged as Valid or Invalid.

4. Supreme Council refinement of RFP into a Proposal.

   - If necessary, reach out to the original author.
   - Reach out to all parties the RFP involves.
   - Research related requirements of RFP.

5. Supreme Council votes on if the Proposal is ready for community voting.

### Proposals

1. Supreme Council has indicated that a Proposal is ready for community voting.

2. All concerned parties are informed that the voting will proceed.

3. The Proposal is published to a third party DAO solution for on-chain voting.

4. The Proposal has a limited timeframe in which votes can be cast.

5. If Quorum is met for the Proposal.

   - All concerned parties are informed that the voting succeeded.
   - Funding is allocated where necessary.
   - Implementation of Proposal may commence

6. If Quorum is not met for the Proposal.

   - All concerned parties are informed that the voting failed.

### Delegated Voters

After the HackenDAO structure is formed, it will use a system of delegated voting. People can delegate their voting power to delegated voters, who will then vote on their behalf. These delegate voters will have higher voting power, not just because of the amount of tokens they use for voting, but also because of the nonlinear function employed in such voting.

In perspective, delegate voters will receive a salary for acting as the representative branch of DAO members.

### Possible Justifications for Rejection

1. **Irrelevant Content**

   The proposal does not align with the DAO's mission, goals, or specific needs outlined in the RFR. For example, it could propose an initiative that doesn't make sense for the organisation or is unrelated to its activities.

2. **Low Quality**

   The proposal is poorly written, lacks detail, or does not provide a clear plan of action. It's evident that minimal effort was put into its creation.

3. **Repeated submissions**

   The same or very similar proposals are submitted multiple times by the same entity, or different entities with a coordinated effort, in an attempt to flood the system or create an illusion of support for a particular idea.

4. **Malicious Intent**

   The proposal is designed to disrupt the DAO's operations, harm its reputation, or unfairly benefit the proposer at the expense of the DAO and its members. This could include scams, attempts to exploit the DAOs governance system, or proposals that involve illegal activities.

5. **Marketing or Self-Promotion**

   The proposal is primarily designed to advertise a product, service, or individual, rather than to offer a genuine and beneficial idea for the DAO

## Management

All operational tasks of hDAO are performed by councils. The top management council is called the Supreme Council and consists of 8 members being elected every 12 months.

Depending on the tasks, the number of councils may increase or decrease.
We do not limit ourselves in the areas of work of the councils. These can be both classical areas (budget, marketing, technical, etc.) and experimental ones (psychological, speculative, events, production, etc.).

#### Councils Operational Rules

- 4 people is a minimum for each Council. Maximum member count has to be defined by each Council itself.

- Quorum needed for official decisions to be valid: 69%

- Internal votings will be put up only on Mondays

- Council voting duration: 48 hours

- Council work summary deadline: 48 hours after the end of weekly voting

- Allowed missed votes by a member in a row: 2

- The membership of the Council members has to be proven in re-elections, every 12 months (with the same process as the very first election)

- Submitting RFPs will cost 0 HAI, but a proposal will be rewarded with 1000 HAI, after the Hacken community approves that proposal, not Supreme Council

#### Responsibilities and KPIs

Each area of HackenDAO will have a responsible entity. This could be a Council, SubDAO, or an individual person.

Every responsible entity should prepare a budget and execution plan, which must be approved by collective voting. The entity will either receive funds or not based on this approval.

KPIs should be suggested by the responsible entity when requesting budgets.
Each responsible entity will receive a salary and bonuses for achieving KPIs, approved by collective voting.

## Treasury

To facilitate transparency, Hacken allocates its treasury reserves to the community, and constructs a way to support trust-improving activities. First – to allocate funds in right internal products and initiatives, then – to finance any worthwhile cybersecurity initiative.

The treasury will be governed by a number of delegates — people who are the most involved and motivated to bring the best for token and ecosystem. Along the way, the number of these people will increase to reach the industry standards.

These delegates are part of the voted Budget Council. To begin with, it has 4 members, as voted in October 2023 by the QCC.

The goals mentioned above can be attained best through partnerships and HAI boosted activities. Thus, hGrants will play an important economical part of hDAO.
hGrants as a part of the DAO allocating resources can be given to fund projects, developers, researchers that meet the needs of a rapidly growing Hacken Ecosystem.

The program covers a wide range of topics including creation of critical web3 security tooling, on-chain data processing automatization, on-chain data visualisation, predictioning, NFTzation, community to community interaction, industry sustainability, social impacting.

After all, treasury funds are meant to grow our cyber security enthusiastic community and generate token value by globally widened acceptance of our cause - make web3 a safer place.

## Closing Words

Hacken is not building a new DAO from scratch. It is transforming the community around the project into a fully decentralised structure. The goals remain the same - they are shared by everyone. This structure includes both company employees and token holders. The company transfers all its potential and developments to the hDAO, which is a significant contribution. It does not cease to be a commercial organisation; it simply becomes a more transparent connection with clearer roles. Token owners from the company have rights and possibly responsibilities, while other token holders also have rights and responsibilities.

By accepting this whitepaper via on-chain voting we hereby celebrate the birth of hDAO. However, it has to be clear that it is open to modifications. Eventually, a newer version would be marked as such.

To a bright future of hDAO!
